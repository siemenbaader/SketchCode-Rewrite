SketchCode Coding Document

Capture (unsorted)
==================
- must distinguish between non-editable elements & non-removeable elements from editor
- document cursor APIs & blog about contenteditable code editor



Actions
=======
- code editor love:
  - BSP key in fields
    - fix selection deletion & first ev  OK
    - BSP on empty line must remove line break & go up to prev line  OK
    - DEL at end of field must not go into next field OK
    - in menu mode, backspace & DEL mustrespect fields as well  OK
    - DEL & BSP outside a concept & no selection must select it  OK
      - then, del & BSP will just remove it 					OK
    - cursor must move outside the concept element on selection end OK

    - make nested tags fold properly according to body content  OK
    - make DEL & BSP aware of BR elements
    - fix BR insertion mash
    - track down bug: DEL in field that has a non-displayed last element (eg SPC or BR) moves cur out of field.

  - arrow key navigation & columns
    - selection should not be able to leave an editable field
- set up iTerm
- overview of jQuery (briefly)

Issues
======
- add final spacer is buggy and adds endlessly
  - check if cursor at EOL in element, then just add 2x BR tag
  - Node.has_line_breaks(): check for inlined brs or 2x at end
  - backspace removes a trailing BR & the next non-semantics field. remove BR like a normal char.

- Editor love: add backspace del prevention in fields


BR vs DIV desing decision
=========================
- copy & paste problems
- br insertion



Editor love - identified issues that are no show-stoppers
=========================================================
- click right of rich widget must put the cursor to the end of line  OK
  works for comment, but only inline
- arrow left inside rich widget must put the cursor left of widget
- cursor left at col 0 beneath rich widget must put the cursor to end of one above
  (works for comment, not DeclAssign) 
- backspace on line above comment must move comment up to that linetextedi
- var must be an inline element; i.e. curser must be able to move left & right of it
- cursor in fields in concept must be able to go up to line above
- BSP at the end of a concept must not continue into the fields, but DEL the entire concept
  - select into a concept must select the entire concept as a whole

- cursor to the very left of var inputs in the document, but is show in the red border. Must be shown outside.
- cursor arrowed right in var must be visible 
- cursor sometimes gets lost
- BSP above DeclarationAssignment does nothing
- BSP above 

  With whitespaces, editing with mouse and keys is acceptable for now. Help from Joe?
